Hello team, 
This repo contains the login, signup and homeScreen and bookmarkScreen.
Implemented the following: 
1. MVVM pattern
2. swiftui for UI
3. keychain and userdefaults for data storing
4. rest api for network calls
5. custom commom components and utitly class written for the helping
6. navigation stack used
7. use autologin

   
note:

the country code api wasn't working when was trying to hit, so it's not implemented.
the openlibrary api has no attributes for average rating and hits so inplace of that i've used first publication year and author name in the sorting filter

Please check the 4 videos attached for the working idea for login, signup , homescreen and bookmark
